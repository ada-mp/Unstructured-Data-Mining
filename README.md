# Unstructured-Data-Mining
This repository showcases projects developed in the graduate-level *Unstructured Data Mining* course, attended in the 2st semester of 2024 as a special undergraduate student.
The projects apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems involving text and image data.

## 📌 Projects
### 1️⃣ Fake News Classification
- **Goal**: Compare different text representations (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, SBERT, DistilBERT) for *fake news* classification.
- **Dataset**: WELFake dataset
- **Methods**: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Sentence-BERT, DistilBERT, k-Nearest Neighbors, Wilcoxon Test
- **Results**: DistilBERT outperformed other methods in distinguishing real and fake news.

### 2️⃣ Synthetic Image Classification
- **Goal**: Investigate the performance of different image representations for classifying synthetic vs. real images.
- **Dataset**: CIFAKE dataset
- **Methods**: Color histograms, Haralick texture descriptors, ResNet embeddings, k-NN, Wilcoxon Test
- **Results**: ResNet-18 showed superior performance over classical approaches.
